# dayflow
Day Flow was made to be an interactive planning app. It utilized html, javascript, css, bootstrap, and Jquery. 

When I click a field,
THEN I can put text there.
When I click off that field,
Then my data is saved to Local storage.
When an hour passes, 
Then the colors adjust to indicate past, resent or future.
When the page is refreshed,
Then the saved data persists.
